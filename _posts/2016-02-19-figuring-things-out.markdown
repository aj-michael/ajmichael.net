Today I set up this website. It took way longer than I care to admit and there are several other things that I should have been doing. But I'm glad I did it. For several reasons that maybe I'll get into later.

For now I'm going back to fixing the home page. (Seriously, Jekyll? I can only paginate index.html?)
