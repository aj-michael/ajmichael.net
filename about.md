My name is Adam Michael. I am 21 years old. I hate building websites, so today is off to a terrible start.

I study mathematics and things like mathematics at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. On the side I work as a software engineer, currently for Rose-Hulman Ventures. Previously for Quantcast, Google and Microsoft.

Occasionally I respond to emails at adam@ajmichael.net.

I spend a lot of time writing mediocre code on [github](https://github.com/aj-michael). Currently 90% of my time is going to my senior capstone project, [thepathfinder.xyz](https://thepathfinder.xyz).
